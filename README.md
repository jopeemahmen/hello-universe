A legend is born. My first project in Github.

Hello,

Jopee here. I graduated from a course I totally don't like. I spent the past 5 years doing something I don't like for a living.
However, I have risen from the dead and ready to go pursur my passions once again.
My goal is to help people with my works and ride on the wave technology as I go along.
